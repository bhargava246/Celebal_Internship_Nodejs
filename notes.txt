REPL

read-eval-print-loop , its an env allows you to execute js code in one statement at a time

after entering node in terminal we enter into repl


Note js behaves differently in browser and node env, in browser window is defined while in node windor is not defined
Node has global object

globalThis is a keyword which access the global oject depending upon the env

 modules

self-contained code unit:
 in order to import a module in app.js or any other file we need to first export that function or module

encapsulation:

nodejs used common js by default(module.export,require) to ensure the code in one file does not pollute or interfere with the global scope

this makes your code modular,maintainable and easier to debug

in module.export only the last one is counted or exported even if there are multiple functions

i.e if u want to export multiple modules export it using 

module.export.add = add;
module.export.multiply = multiply;
or
module.exports = {add,multiply}
and import using const {add,multiply} = require('');
